# Exploring Prompt Engineering with the ChatGPT API

Recently, I took an amazing course on Coursera, [Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT API](https://www.coursera.org/learn/rudi-hinds-prompt-engineering-with-chatgpt-api-generate-exam-questions) by Rudi Hinds. It dives deep into how to craft and optimize prompts using the ChatGPT API. The course gave me great insight into building better prompts for AI models, focusing on generating exam questions.

_One thing to note:_ the course primarily uses Jupyter notebooks and the pre-1.0.0 version of the `openai` library. While this setup works great for many, I decided to make some tweaks to suit my workflow. Instead of sticking with notebooks, I’m using a regular IDE for my development, paired with the latest version of the `openai` library as of September 7, 2024.

If you're curious about prompt engineering and want to follow along with some code, check the code in this repository. It’s a fun dive into prompt crafting, with some modern adjustments!
